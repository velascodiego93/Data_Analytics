PowerBI dashboard documentation analyzing the relationship between personal data, survey answers and political orientation 
The motivation for this study arises from the desire to verify, based on real data from the American population, whether certain individual profiles can indeed be associated with a particular political orientation. In this way, it will be possible to determine if these stereotypes are somehow aligned with reality, as well as to identify other profiles that may be associated with a specific political orientation.
